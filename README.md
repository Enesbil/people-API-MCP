# Crustdata MCP Demo

A proof-of-concept MCP server for the Crustdata API (based only on publicly available docs) . This exposes all of Crustdata's company, people, and web APIs as tools that AI assistants can discover and call.

## Quick note

This runs in dry-run mode since I don't have API access yet. When you call a tool, it shows you exactly what request would be sent to the Crustdata API. The structure is all there, just swap in real HTTP calls when you have credentials.

## Tools

### Company APIs
- **crustdata_enrich_company** - Enrich companies by domain, name, LinkedIn URL, or ID
- **crustdata_screen_companies** - Filter companies by headcount, funding, location, skills, etc.
- **crustdata_search_companies** - Real-time company search with structured filters
- **crustdata_get_company_people** - Get employees and decision makers at a company

### People APIs
- **crustdata_enrich_person** - Enrich LinkedIn profiles or business emails
- **crustdata_search_people** - Find people by company, title, seniority, industry, etc.
- **crustdata_get_linkedin_posts** - Get LinkedIn posts and engagement metrics

### Web APIs
- **crustdata_web_search** - SERP search with geolocation and source filtering
- **crustdata_web_fetch** - Fetch HTML content from URLs

### Utility
- **crustdata_ping** - Test that the server is running

## Setup

```bash
cd crustDataMCP
pip install -e .
```

## Running

```bash
python -m crustdata_mcp_demo.server
```

Or use the runner script:

```bash
python run_server.py
```

## Using with Cursor

Add to your MCP config (`.cursor/mcp.json` in your project or global Cursor settings):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crustdata": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["c:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\dev\\projects\\crustDataMCP\\run_server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Cursor after adding the config.
